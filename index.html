        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <span>
          This website covers the history of mass incarceration. Mass incarceration is the unique way in which the United States of America has imprisoned a collection of its population. Although mass incarceration is often overlooked, it is a real problem in society. As we learned in class, mass incarceration posses as a threat to society because historically disenfranchised minorities and the poor are primarily targeted.<br><br>

          <h2>Mass Elimination</h2>
        <span>
          It is the purging and containment of targeted peoples in America. It is the institutionalized method of putting down societal “undesirables.” We will be exploring the history of Mass Incarceration, learning about its roots and what it is today.<br><br>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <span>
          Settlers abused, manipulated, and exploited natives. Colonists pushed them into economic dependency and forced manual labor upon them. This formed a structural hierarchy between settlers and natives - a social divide between the “elite” and the “dominated.” This paved the road to the institutionalization of incarceration as a method of abuse and manipulation of those deemed lower within the social hierarchy. It was a way of eliminating the minorities. <br><br>
        </span>
        <h2>The Lost Treaties</h2>
        <span>
          In return for relinquishing land claims, ceasing hostilities, and acknowledging the United States, the natives would receive undesirable land and other provisions. However, all of these treaties were conveniently lost and never ratified. The loss of land led to an accelerated criminalization in California. This led to incarceration and an attempted elimination of native society.

        <h2>New Beginning</h2>
        <span>
          The history of Settler abuse and exploitation as a means of establishing social divides and elimination evolved into racial stratification. After the abolition, many black families moved to Los Angeles to have a new beginning. <br><br>
          At first they were well received, but this was only because of their relatively low numbers. When the black population became too high, the city elites and authorities quickly incorporated tactics to demean, limit, and cage black life. They were segregated into ghettos and subject to sudden and violent police raids. Police brutality and incarceration were used to eliminate society’s racial impurities and establish the societal “elites.”

        <h2>The School to Prison Pipeline</h2>
        <span>
          Students, primarily of color, are being pushed out of school and into the criminal legal system through excessive suspensions, expulsions, arrests, and an over-reliance on high stakes testing. Children of disadvantaged backgrounds are often funneled from schools and neighborhoods into underemployment and imprisonmet.

        <h2>Settler Colonialism</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Settlers took advantage of native peoples and established a social hierarchy where they stood at the top and everybody else was at the bottom.</li>
          <li>Once the natives were economically dependent, they were forced into manual labor. It was a precursor to slavery.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Slavery</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Black peoples were forced into lives of labor against their free will.</li>
          <li>Once abolition came about, the Black population were forced into a new era of abuse and exploitation: The Jim Crow South. However, this was just slavery by another name.</li>
          <li>This led to the establishment of a racial hierarchy between the white man and the black man.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Racial Stratification and Mass Incarceration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Minority groups today, while it is an avoided topic, are the targets of societal elimination. In Los Angeles, blacks and latinos are the main victims that suffer under racial profiling and police scrutiny.</li>
          <li>They are placed under disadvantaged conditions, unfairly targeted by law enforcement, given fewer employment opportunities, funneled into crime, and placed into prison.</li>
